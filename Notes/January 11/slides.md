What a human tells it to do

> “What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind... And that’s really the essence of programming. By the time you’ve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you’ve certainly learned something about it yourself.”
― Douglas Adams, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

**Computation** is any type of calculation that includes both arithmetic and non-arithmetic steps and which follows a well-defined model (e.g., an **algorithm**).

A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.

A **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)**, also known as an interactive shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (READ) (i.e. single expressions), EVALUATES them, and returns (PRINTS) the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.
