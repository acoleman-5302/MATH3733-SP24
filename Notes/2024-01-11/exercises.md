# Exercises

**Exercise 1: More on `print()`**

Run the following commands and observe the output.

``` python
print('Single Quotes')
```

``` python
print("Double Quotes")
```

``` python
print('''Triples Quotes are extra
    helpful because they allow a string
    to span multiple lines. Don't forget
    to try this with 'single quotes' and
    "double" quotes.''')
```

``` python
print("Why can't I use single quotes here?")
# Be sure to answer the question as well
```

Now write a program that generates the following output:

``` text
Hello, I'm happy you decided to run this "Python" program!
```

**Exercise 2: Primes** An integer $p$ is prime if $1$ and $p$ are its only divisors. Show that $149$ is a prime number. Use the fact that $p$ is prime if $p$ `%` $n \neq 0$ for all $n \leq \sqrt{p}$.

**Exercise 3: Fermat's Theorem on the sum of two squares** Fermat's Two Squares Theorem states every prime number $p$ of the form $4k+1$ can be expressed as the some of two squares. For example $5 = 2^2 + 1^1$.

Show that $149$ is of the form $4k+1$ and find numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = 149$.

**Exercise 4: Reading on variables** Read the article [https://realpython.com/python-variables/](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) and answer the following questions.

- How do you assign multiple variables on the same line to the same value?
- What is met by the statement, "A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object."?
- Is `n_a_m_E` a valid variable name?
- What is the difference between Camel, Pascal, and Snake case?
