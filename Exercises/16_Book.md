# Book

Functions are very useful in programming, as they give us the oppertunity to have some variety. For example, observe this function:

```python
def add(x, y, z):
  addedNumbers = x + y + z
  print(addedNumbers)

add(1, 2, 3)
add(4, 9, 2)
```

The cool part, is that we can call the `add()` function as many times as we would like, with different arguments for our x,y,and z parameters.

# Instructions

Write a function called `favorite_book` that accepts one parameter, `title`. The function should **print** the message "One of my favorite books is {`title`}".


# Test Case 1
```
>>> favorite_book("The Bible")
