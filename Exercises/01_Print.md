# More on `print()`

Run the following commands and observe the output.

``` python
print('Single Quotes')
```

``` python
print("Double Quotes")
```

``` python
print('''Triples Quotes are extra
    helpful because they allow a string
    to span multiple lines. Don't forget
    to try this with 'single quotes' and
    "double" quotes.''')
```

``` python
print("Why can't I use single quotes here?")
# Be sure to answer the question as well
```

Now write a program that generates the following output:

``` text
Hello, I'm happy you decided to run this "Python" program!
```

<details>
<summary style="font-weight:bold">Solution</summary>
<br>
    
``` python
print('''Hello, I'm happy you decided to run this "Python" program!''')
```
