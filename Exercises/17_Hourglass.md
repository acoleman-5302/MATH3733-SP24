# Hourglass
Copy the following code into your codespace:
```python
def outer():
    ...

def edge():
    ...

def almost_middle():
    ...

def middle():
    ...

def build_hourglass():
    ...

def build_diamond():
    ...

##
## DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE
##
build_hourglass()
print()
build_diamond()
```

Replace the `...` in the function definitions with `print` statements to build an hourglass and a diamond. 

A function without a body will result in an error, so elipses `...` are used as placeholder. This way development can occur without the Python interpreter raising errors. 

Use functions to break up the problem into reusable blocks of code, **but do NOT change function names**.
