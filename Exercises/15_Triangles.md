# Triangles

## Tips

Be sure to use pencil and paper when problem solving. This problems involves the ability to:

- Display a row of symbols of a particular length using a loop
- Display a series of rows using nested loops
- Create a varying number of symbols in each row using an algebraic expressions instead of a fixed value
- Discover the correct algebraic expression through experimentation and analysis

## Instructions

Ask the user for input for a width `w` of a sideways triangle.

Write a program that uses only two output statements, `print("#", end="")` and `print()` to produce triangle of `#` with maximum width `w`.

## Example (`w=1`)

```text
#
```

## Example (`w=2`)

```text
#
##

```

## Example (`w=3`)

```text
