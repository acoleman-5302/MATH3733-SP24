# Lists: Same sign neighbors

Read a list of integers:
a = [int(s) for s in input().split()]

for i in range(0)

Given a list of non-zero integers, find and print the first adjacent pair of elements that have the same sign. If there is no such pair, print **0**.

Do not use the `numpy` module.

# Example input #1

```
-1 2 3 -1 -2
```

# Example output #1

```
2 3
```

# Example input #2

```
1 -3 4 -2 1
```

# Example output #2

```
0
```
