# Day 6: Scope

## Scope

Called a function creates a new **scope**, which is also referred to as a **frame**.

Use [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) to visualize scope.

``` python
def f(x): # name x used as parameter 
    y = 1 
    x = x + y 
    print('x =', x) 
    return x 
    
x = 3 
y = 2 
z = f(x) # value of x used as argument
print('z =', z) 
print('x =', x) 
print('y =', y) 
```

### `global`

Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable.

```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the **global** keyword.

```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

## Challenge

In the following example, observe which functions are defined in which scope.

``` python
def f(x): 
    def g(): 
        x = 'abc' 
        print('x =', x) 

    def h(): 
        z = x 
        print('z =', z) 

    x = x + 1 
    print('x =', x) 
    h() 
    g() 
    print('x =', x) 
    return g 

x = 3 
z = f(x)  # z references g with input x
print('x =', x) 
print('z =', z) 
z()       # g is called
```
