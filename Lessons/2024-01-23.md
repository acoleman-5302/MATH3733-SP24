# Day 04

## Announcements

- Project 1 is due on Thursday, midnight. I will discuss submission instructions on Thursday. For now, you can simply work inside your own codespace.

## Plan

- `for`
-

## `for` loops

`for` loops are used when we know how long we need to iterate.

```python
# This declares a variable named n
# it takes on the values 0 <= i < n,
# incrementing each time through the loop
for n in range(5):
    print(n)
```

Exercise 11 will cover more details about the `range` function.

## `continue`

The `continue` keyword is used to end the current iteration in a loop and continue to the next iteration.

```python
for n in range(5):
    if n == 4:
        continue
    print(n)
```

## Exercise

Compute the sum of the first 123,456,789 *square* integers. That is, find 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{123,456,789} i^2$$

```python
total = 0

for i in range(123_456_789):
    total += i ** 2

print(total)

# Alternatively, use the closed-form formula for the sum of n squares
n = 123_456_789
total = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n +1)) / 6
print(total)
```

## Floating Point Error

Notice that when we use the `type` function to determine the type of a a class, it returns a "class". We will write our own classes later, for now, think of them as an object with its own attributes (values) and methods (functions).

```python
>>> n = 3.14
>>> n.real      # real is an attribute
3.14
>>> n.imag      # imag is an attribute
0.0
>>> n.is_integer()      # is_integer() is a method
False
```

Weird results can be introduced when working with floats. This is not a bug with Python, but a result of trying to represent a decimal (base 10) number in binary (base 2).

```python
# float_error.py
x = 0
inc = 0.1

# Add to one by tenths
for i in range(10):
    x = x + inc

if x == 1.0:
    print(f"{x} is == 1.0")
else:
    print(f"{x} is not 1.0")

# 0.9999999999999999 is not 1.0
```

When comparing floats, check that the error is less than some epsilon.

```python
x = 0
inc = 0.1
epsilon = 0.01

# Add to one by tenths
for i in range(10):
    x = x + inc

if abs(1.00 - x) <= epsilon:
    print(f"{x} is almost 1.0")
else:
    print(f"{x} is not 1.0")

# 0.9999999999999999 is not 1.0
```
