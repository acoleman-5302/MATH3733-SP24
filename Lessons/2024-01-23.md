# Day 04

## Plan

- `for`
-

## `for` loops

`for` loops are used when we know how long we need to iterate.

```python
# This declares a variable named n
# it takes on the values 0 <= i < n,
# incrementing each time through the loop
for n in range(5):
    print(n)
```

Exercise 11 will cover more details about the `range` function.

## `continue`

The `continue` keyword is used to end the current iteration in a loop and continue to the next iteration.

```python
for n in range(5):
    if n == 4:
        continue
    print(n)
```

## Exercise

Compute the sum of the first 123,456,789 *square* integers. That is, find 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{123,456,789} i^2$$

```python
total = 0

for i in range(123_456_789):
    total += i ** 2

print(total)

# Alternatively, use the closed-form formula for the sum of n squares
n = 123_456_789
total = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n +1)) / 6
print(total)
```
