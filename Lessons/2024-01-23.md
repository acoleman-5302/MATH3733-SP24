# Day 04

## Announcements

- Project 1 is due on Thursday, midnight. I will discuss submission instructions on Thursday. For now, you can simply work inside your own codespace.

## Plan

- `for`
- Floating point error
- Bisection Method for root finding

## `for` loops

`for` loops are used when we know how long we need to iterate.

```python
# This declares a variable named n
# it takes on the values 0 <= i < n,
# incrementing each time through the loop
for n in range(5):
    print(n)
```

Exercise 11 will cover more details about the `range` function.

## `continue`

The `continue` keyword is used to end the current iteration in a loop and continue to the next iteration.

```python
for n in range(5):
    if n == 4:
        continue
    print(n)
```

## Exercise

Compute the sum of the first 123,456,789 *square* integers. That is, find 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{123,456,789} i^2$$

```python
total = 0

for i in range(123_456_789):
    total += i ** 2

print(total)

# Alternatively, use the closed-form formula for the sum of n squares
n = 123_456_789
total = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n +1)) / 6
print(total)
```

## Floating Point Error

Notice that when we use the `type` function to determine the type of a a class, it returns a "class". We will write our own classes later, for now, think of them as an object with its own attributes (values) and methods (functions).

```python
>>> n = 3.14
>>> n.real      # real is an attribute
3.14
>>> n.imag      # imag is an attribute
0.0
>>> n.is_integer()      # is_integer() is a method
False
>>> (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) == 0.3
False
>>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004
```

Weird results can be introduced when working with floats. This is *not* a bug with Python, but a result of trying to represent a decimal (base 10) number in binary (base 2).

```python
# float_error.py
x = 0
inc = 0.1

# Add to one by tenths
for i in range(10):
    x = x + inc

if x == 1.0:
    print(f"{x} is == 1.0")
else:
    print(f"{x} is not 1.0")

# 0.9999999999999999 is not 1.0
```

When comparing floats, check that the error is less than some epsilon.

```python
x = 0
inc = 0.1
epsilon = 0.01

# Add to one by tenths
for i in range(10):
    x = x + inc

if abs(1.00 - x) <= epsilon:
    print(f"{x} is almost 1.0")
else:
    print(f"{x} is not 1.0")

# 0.9999999999999999 is not 1.0
```

## Floating Point Error Explanation

We can represent the decimal number 302 using expanded notation as
$$(3 \times 10^2) + (0 \times 10^1) + (2 \times 10^0)$$

A sequence of length $n$ can $10^n$ different number. E.g., if $n = 3$, we can represent 1000 numbers (0, 1, ..., 999).

Computers use _binary_ (base 2), and a binary number is represent by a sequence of digits, each of which is either 0 or 1, often called **bits**. For example, $101_2$ is the binary number equivalent to the decimal number 5. To see this, use expanded notation:

$$101_2 = (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 1) = 5$$

What is the decimal equivalent of the binary number $10011_2$?

The answer is $1 + 2 + 16 = 19$.

Let's now turn out attention to representing floats. We can represent a decimal number using the significant digits of a number and an exponent. For example, $1.949$ could be represented as the pair $(1949, -3) = 1949 \times 10^{-3}$.

<!-- How would you represent 0.625 = 5/8 using expanded notation?

First, 0.625 = 6/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000 = $(6 \times 10^{-1}) + (2 \times 10^{-2}) + (5 \times 10^{-3})$. -->

How would you represent 0.625 = 5/8 as a binary number? (101, -11) = $5 \times 2^{-3}$. This works perfectly since 8 is a power of two.

Returning to our program above, what about 1/10 = 0.1? With four bits, the best we could do it 0.09375 = 3 / 32 as (0011, -0101), or $3 \times 2^{-5}$ using decimal.

Most implementations of Python use 53 bits of precision.

## Finding the Square Root

## Method 1: Exhaustive Enumeration (a.k.a Guess-and Check)

``` python
# Find the square root of a perfect square
x = int(input())
num_guesses = 0
guess = 0

# increment guess until its square is at least as large as the input being checked
while guess ** 2 < x:
    num_guesses += 1
    guess += 1
print(guess)

# check if the input is a perfect square
if guess ** 2 != x:
    print(x, "is not a perfect square")
else:
    print(f"The square root of {x} is {guess}")

print(f"The algorithm took {num_guesses} guesses")
```

This algorithm will take 35,137 guesses to determine *if* 1,234,567,890 is a perfect square.

There is a better algorithm, called a bisection search, that will take 51 guesses - and actually, *compute* the value of the square root.

<!-- Before using bisection search to find the square root, let's use it to find a value in a *sorted* list.

Consider the list [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89], and find 21. There are 9 values, so start in the middle (1 + 9) -->

Here is the idea:

Which number would be encountered to find the square root of 100?

``` text
18     = (0 + 36) / 2       # 18^2 is greater than 36, lower b (right endpoint)
9      = (0 + 18) / 2       # 9^2 is greater than 36, lower b
4.5    = (0 + 9) / 2        # 4.5^2 = 20.25 is less than 36 so raise a (left endpoint)
6.75   = (4.5 + 9) / 2      # 6.75^2 = 45.56 is greater than 36 so lower b
5.625  = (4.5 + 6.75) / 2   # 5.625^2 = 31.640625 is less than 36 so raise a
6.1875 = (5.625 + 6.75) / 2 # 6.1875^2 = 38.285 is greater than 36 so raise b
...
```
